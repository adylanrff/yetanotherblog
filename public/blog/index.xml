      <description>Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s so hard. - David McCullough&#xA;I can now understand what differentiates between a good expert versus a great expert: the quality of their writing. Good expert understands how the thing works; great expert understand how the thing works and how to communicate it clearly. Clarity here is the keyword. If you cannot explain a problem clearly, you may not fully understand the problem yet.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is me trying to be vulnerable. This post may offend or is too dramatic for some readers. So skip it if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to.&#xA;I am writing this post as a remembrance that I have failed to be a stoic. Sigh, I wrote this &amp;ldquo;stoic&amp;rdquo; thing everywhere in my bio. Turns out I don&amp;rsquo;t deserve one. At least for now.&#xA;The Incident Today, I have heard a lot of good news about my friends.</description>

      <description>Just like every other developers in the planet, we tend to create a brand new blog every single year.&#xA;I try to keep it simple though this time. The goal of this blog is not to promote myself as someone that can build a website, but to learn how to write properly. I do not want it to be a &amp;ldquo;goal&amp;rdquo; like a year ago when I tried to create &amp;ldquo;30 Days of Writing&amp;rdquo; challenge and failed miserably in the middle of the challenge.</description>
