      <description>Just like every other developers in the planet, we tend to create a brand new blog every single year.
I try to keep it simple though this time. The goal of this blog is not to promote myself as someone that can build a website, but to learn how to write properly. I do not want it to be a &amp;ldquo;goal&amp;rdquo; like a year ago when I tried to create &amp;ldquo;30 Days of Writing&amp;rdquo; challenge and failed miserably in the middle of the challenge.</description>
