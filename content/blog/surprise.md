It is true, life takes you to unexpected places. Manifesting works, and it works in unexpected ways.

In 2019, I wrote a tweet: 
```txt
so heres my plan

lulus -> spore -> europe/us -> remote work
```

0. Working while studying at a local remote startup around 2019. 
1. Got a job offer for a role in Shopee Singapore in 2020.  
2. Graduated from ITB in 2020. 
3. Worked in Singapore for 4 years, until now.
4. Got a job offer for a role in Germany in 2024.
5. I will relocate to Germany (Hamburg) in 2025.  

If this single tweet is the entire career summary of my life, then I will just wait until I get my remote job offer. 

Viel Glück für mich!
