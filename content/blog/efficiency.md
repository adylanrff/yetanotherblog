Efficiency is boring. 

Modern world is all about the numbers. The bigger the better. The leaner the better. How to produce X by spending less than Y amount of money. 

Imagine a world where everything is 100% efficient. Huge returns with near zero work. This world would mean nothing. Humans will only be consuming, not producing. Working is meaningless. Living is meaningless. 

How do you optimize friendships? How do you optimize art? How do you optimize fun? How do you optimize these things that make you human?

Being humane is not about being efficient. It is to embrace the struggle, the failures, the restarts, the inefficiency. 

Efficiency is still boring.
