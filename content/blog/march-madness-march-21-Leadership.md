Being a leader is not about giving the loudest roar to the pack. It is not about cracking the hardest whip to the slowest horse of the carriage. It is not about pushing and shoving. 

A leader is all about example. A role model. Be the compass to the north star. 

It is hard, yet fulfilling. 

You need to embody the mission and share it with the rest. Guide, and empower your troops. Be commanding yet understanding. Be passionate on your goal and compassionate to your people.
