Just like every other developers in the planet, we tend to create a brand new blog every single year. 

I try to keep it simple though this time. The goal of this blog is not to promote myself as someone that can build a website, but to learn how to write properly. I do not want it to be a "goal" like a year ago when I tried to create "*30 Days of Writing*" challenge and failed miserably in the middle of the challenge. I just want to make sure that I have the platform to spill my thoughts in a structured manner (unlike, let's say, tweet storms like I always do in my alt Twitter account). I also hope that the content of this blog is useful to the readers.

For what it's worth, it will be mostly written in either Bahasa Indonesia or English. 

I hope this platform serves well.
